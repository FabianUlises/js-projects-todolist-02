# Missing complete status
Able to add, delete, and edit tasks by toggling (readonly) attribute on html tag. Element is also an Input tag instead of an li <br/>
so you can edit the task if you with to do so.<br/>
Has localstorage functionality to save and delete 
Im using .value to add text to dom elements which i asume is preventing xss.

# Bugs
I've notice sometimes when I delete a task the page reloads the tasks im asuming from the localstorage & randomly sorts them.
